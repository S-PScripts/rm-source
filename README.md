# rm-source
- RM SafetyNet Go extension files compiled
- Done using https://robwu.nl/crxviewer/ (used https://safetynet-chrome-extension.azureedge.net/SafetyNetChromeExtension.crx)
- The extension has been updated to use Manifest 3 since it was broken in chromeOS v139 (I got the files this time simply using the extension ID).
- mv3 version (v3.1.1, not v3.1.0): https://github.com/S-PScripts/rm-source-mv3/tree/main
